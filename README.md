# GLASS-ENGN1760
My final presentation for ENGN1760: Design of Space Systems, in which I served as software lead. 
Our project goal was to create a detailed mission spec and proposal for a ground-based laser-propelled photon sail for accelerating heavy payloads out of LEO.
I developed novel astrodynamics simulations for the project in Poliastro (and later Orekit), along with aiding in the design and construction of the final sail build project, which we deployed in class during our presentation.
